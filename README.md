# Data Science Regression Project-Forecasting Housing Prices in Bangalore
The dataset is downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data

In this data science project, a real estate price prediction model has been developed using the scikit-learn library and linear regression algorithm. The project utilizes the Bangalore home prices dataset obtained from Kaggle.com. The model-building process encompasses various fundamental concepts in data science. These include loading and cleaning the dataset, detecting and removing outliers, performing feature engineering to enhance the dataset, applying dimensionality reduction techniques, and utilizing grid search cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, k-fold cross-validation is employed to evaluate the model's performance and ensure robustness. By incorporating these essential concepts, this project comprehensively demonstrates the end-to-end process involved in predicting real estate prices.

Technology and tools wise this project covers,

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
